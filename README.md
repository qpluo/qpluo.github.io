Hi, I am Qiongpeng Luo (last/family name: Luo; first/given name: Qiongpeng；in Chinese characters: 罗琼鹏 (simplified) or 羅瓊鵬 (traditional)). I am a linguist specializing in formal semantics and semantics-syntax interface with special reference to Mandarin Chinese and other languages in China and East Asia. I studied linguistics at Utrecht University from 2007-2008 (under the supervision of Prof. Martin Everaert and the late Tanya Reinhart) and Peking University, from which I obtained my PhD degree in 2009. I worked as a post-doc research fellow at Macquarie Center for Cognitive Science of Macquarie University from 2009-2011 (under Prof. Stephen Crain). Currently I am an associate professor of linguistics at the School of Liberal Arts, Nanjing University, China.


## **Research Interests**

- **Broad**: Formal semantics and semantics-pragmatics interface;
- **Narrow**: (1) Degree and measurement; (2) Semantic incorporation; (3) Expressive meanings; (4) The semantics of kind; (5) Event structure and verbal semantics.
